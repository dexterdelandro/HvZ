 Academic Project with basic AI in a Humans vs Zombies Simulation

This was an academic project, where we had to implement basic AI with vector based phsics. There "humans" have to avoid the "zombies" if there are any "zombies" in their detection range. When they're not in the range, the "humans" would wander around the park. The zombies automatically chase the closest "human", and when they get close enough, they turn the "human" into a "zombie".

To run the game, download the "Delandro_HVZ_Final" folder, and then run "Delandro_HVZ.exe" executable in the "Delandro_HVZ_FINAL_Build" folder.
